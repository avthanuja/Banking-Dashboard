# Banking Loan Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project leverages Power BI and SQL to analyze banking loan data, assess risk, and track key metrics. The interactive dashboard visualizes loan performance, default risks, and customer trends using advanced DAX measures and SQL queries.

## Features
- **Loan Portfolio Monitoring**: Created KPI measures using DAX to visualize total loan applications, funded amounts, and received payments.
- **Risk Analysis**: Used SQL queries to categorize loans into good and bad based on repayment status, further analyzed with DAX calculations.
- **Trend Tracking**: Implemented time-intelligence DAX measures to display monthly trends and variations in loan amounts and customer behavior.
- **Regional & Demographic Analysis**: Designed Power BI visualizations to evaluate loan distribution by state, employment length, and homeownership.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: Developed interactive dashboards with visuals including bar charts, line graphs, tree maps, and donut charts.
- **SQL**: Extracted and transformed data using queries for KPI calculations, filtering, and aggregations.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Created calculated columns and measures for dynamic insights into loan trends and customer segmentation.

## Key SQL Queries Used
- Aggregated total loan applications, funded amounts, and payments using `SUM()` and `COUNT()` functions.
- Implemented time-based calculations for Month-to-Date (MTD) and Previous Month-to-Date (PMTD) comparisons.
- Segmented loan statuses using `CASE WHEN` conditions to classify good and bad loans.

## How to Use
1. Open the `Banking Dashboard PowerBI.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Interact with the visuals and slicers to analyze loan data trends and risk factors.
3. Modify SQL queries or Power BI measures to adapt insights to specific business needs.

## Key Insights
- Identified high-risk loan categories using SQL-based default rate analysis and Power BI visualizations.
- Mapped customer profiles to loan performance using DAX-driven segmentation.
- Enhanced decision-making through time-series trend tracking and KPI benchmarking.
